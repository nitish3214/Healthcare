## Team:-

## Problem Statement:-

Rapid increase in the demand of platelets has been  seen in our country in past recent months. Each  year, an estimated 400 million people are infected  with dengue virus, 100 million become ill with  dengue and other diseases, and 21,000 deaths are  attributed to dengue.

It is very difficult to find a donor for platelet in our country  due to heavy demand in outbreak of dengue and other  diseases.
Intervention of lots of third party between donor and  acceptor causes delay to get platelet at the right time  which is a major factor between life and death of the  sufferer.
The major need of platelet has been seen mostly in cases  of dengue because its proper medicine is not yet invented.

## Solution:-

The main solution of this problem is to remove third party  intervention between donor and acceptor of platelet.
Hence we coming with a revolutionary solution by building our  application 'Donate N Save' which reduces search time of the  platelet, and provides one-to-one interaction between donor  and acceptor.
The acceptor can directly reach out to donor to get the  platelet at the right time.
